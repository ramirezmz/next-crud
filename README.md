# [NEXT CRUD](https://next-crud-six.vercel.app/)

Hello everyone, this is a project that I learned from [COD3R](https://youtu.be/HJN5rX-3SDM).

It's about CRUD, for those who dont't know CRUD is the composition of the first letter of 4 basic functions of a system that works with a database.
* C = Create
* R = Read
* U = Update
* D = Delete
  

## What I learned with this project
  * NextJS
  * Tailwindcss
  * React hooks
  * Environment setup of the project
  * Typecript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
